# Twine-Minigame-1
## Devlog
Prompt 1.) I found these tutorials somewhat easy to get through. My personal experience and comfort level with using computers is not that high becasue I rarely use them. I'd say this affects me somewhat because I need to learn all these news programs or apps that I have never used before.
Prompt 2.) I had medium time effort with this assignment for the week. The only resource I used was Discord because I was more familar with it than Canvas or other resources. I might try to use Youtube next time becasue being able to pause the video is helpful.
